After viewing the tutorials mentioned in the Learning Materials page on VisualVM and JProfiler, choose one of them, and install it. Use it to profile the following program:

Write a Java application that does the following. The Main method should:

Call a new method which adds 2,000,000 random integers into an ArrayList, then deletes each one from the ArrayList

Call a new method which adds 2,000,000 random integers into a LinkedList, then deletes each one from the LinkedList

Call a new method which adds 2,000,000 random integers into a Hashtable, then deletes each one from the Hashtable

Turn in the following,
- Your source code (.java file)
- Screen shots of the profiler, showing the relative performance of each of the collection classes
- Answer this question: Which method had the longest runtime?
- Design tools (such as Input Process Output (IPO), flow chart, pseudocode or any other design tools you like)
